# ai-project-character-recognition
An AI based program which can recognize handwritten english alphabets and digits(0-9) using Deep Learning.

### For windows:
Make sure you have python3(along with pip) and ghostscript installed.  If not, you can install them using "python.exe", and for ghostscript using "ghostscript64.exe" for x64 based systems and using "ghostscript32.exe" for x32 based systems.<br>
To install other requirements:<br>
```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```<br>
To train the model:<br>
```python3 train.py```<br>
To predict the handwritten inputs:<br>
```python3 main.py```<br>
